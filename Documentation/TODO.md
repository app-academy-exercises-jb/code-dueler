* make choose challenge modal
* host should be able to click on challenge Q title and see choose challenge modal in game lobby
* when hosting game, one should see the choose challenge modal

- when a players submits submit, they should see an indication, and the button should be locked

- the backend needs to be totally reworked
  - the ideal would be to have a web platform where one could upload Q's w/ reference implementations and test cases
  - failing that a larger collection of algo questions will be necessary
