* host should be able to click on challenge Q title and see choose challenge modal
* when hosting game, one should see the choose challenge modal
* make choose challenge modal
* challenge Q's should take titles

* non-persisting status messages

* work on coding judge so that it does more than one thing

Soon-Mi:
* ability to choose which problem you want to duel in
* more probs than just fizzbuzz

- add welcome message
​
- It would be nice if the editor saved its value to the cache (for reconnections in a single game)
​
- when a players submits submit, they should see an indication, and the button should be locked

- if both players submit within a short time of each other, and at least one is correct, the modals go crazy

- get rid of all of the invitation nonsense  

- the backend needs to be totally reworked
  - the ideal would be to have a web platform where one could upload Q's w/ reference implementations and test cases
  - failing that a larger collection of algo questions will be necessary
