- add welcome message

- players inGame should be marked as such in the main lobby

- Pass error snippet and stacktrace for error modal
​
- It would be nice if the editor saved its value to the cache
​
- Add tabbed view (chat/code challenge) for the game+spectator screen
​
- List users on the third screen
​​
- error / status modals don't work until both players submit at least once

- when a players submits submit, they should see an indication, and the button should be locked

- if both players submit within a short time of each other, and at least one is correct, the modals go crazy


- get rid of all of the invitation nonsense
- allow players to create games.
  - game lobby with pending games
  - everyone can stay in the main chat, but they get status notifs next to their names
  

- the backend needs to be totally reworked
  - the ideal would be to have a web platform where one could upload Q's w/ reference implementations and test cases
  - failing that a larger collection of algo questions will be necessary
