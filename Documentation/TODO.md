### needs to get done:
* plus signs not working in prod (in game lobby, Players / Spectators buttons)

* game won notif does: "undefined just beat x at a code duel!", should actually use the winning player's username

* credits link should not appear on credits page

* dropdown menu lies behind welcome screen

* when a players submits code, they should see an indication (animation), and the button should be locked

* make choose challenge modal
* host should be able to click on challenge Q title and see choose challenge modal in game lobby
* when hosting game, one should see the choose challenge modal

* work on coding judge so that it does more than one thing

* if both players submit within a short time of each other, and at least one is correct, the modals go crazy

* leverage the remnants of the invitation nonsense to give the Host the ability to 'invite players' to the current game

### nice to haves:
* It would be nice if the editor saved its value to the cache (for reconnections in a single game)

* the backend needs to be totally reworked
    - the ideal would be to have a web platform where one could upload Q's w/ reference implementations and test cases
    - add to that a larger collection of algo questions
