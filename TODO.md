### needs to get done:

### nice to haves:
* add spectator's view of a live match to "welcome to CodeDueler" splash page

* if both players submit within a short time of each other, and at least one is correct, the modals go crazy

* login/signup errors should be descriptive

* tooltip can sometimes be made to stay visible, especially in game lobby. find out how to reproduce and fix

* when hosting game, while in game lobby, one should be able to change the challenge and its language

* leverage the remnants of the invitation nonsense to give the Host the ability to 'invite players' to the current game

* It would be nice if the editor saved its value to the cache (for reconnections in a single game)

* the backend needs to be totally reworked
    - the ideal would be to have a web platform where one could upload Q's w/ reference implementations and test cases
    - add to that a larger collection of algo questions

* when in game lobby, and screen width is such that the hamburger menu is visible, put the relevant game action button (start game, un/ready, claim/challenge) at the bottom of the sidebar
